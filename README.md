# TicTacToe-NodeJS-TypeScript

A simplistic implementation of tic-tac-toe using Node.js, TypeScript, the readline module, and events.

Main logic can be found at:

* `./src/index.ts`

# How To Run It

Clone the repo, then run `yarn start` from your CLI.

* Run `yarn install` beforehand if you want to play around with the code.

* The project uses the command `yarn build` to compile the TS code into JS.
